# Notes from ReactJS Developer course (w/ Hooks and Redux)
## Setup quick local server to get public server live
npm install -g live -server
live-server <folder_with_html_file> (This will automatically open a tab in browser with you html file).
Ex: live-server public

## Setup ReactJS
npm init to create package.json file to handle project dependencies.
### Folder structure:
public (folder that will be loaded to be serve)
 - script (will contain autogenerated files to load into browser. Compiled files from the src folder). These files
 will automatically change when the src folder files are compiled. The app file from the script is the one to be loaded
 in the html file of the public folder throught the div.
src (Folder with all of our app's logic)

### Configure babeljs to compile the jsx code down to js (ES5).
npm install -g babel-cli
npm install babel-preset-react babel-preset-env

Create div tag that will load all you react app from the ReactDom function inside the body of the index.html
file in public folder.

Create script folder to contain your compiled scripts.

Create app.js file inside script folder which will be update automatically in the future when the src/app.js
file is compiled.

Create src folder at project root level.

Create your app.js file inside src folder which will be your starting point for your react app.

--> To manually compile a file from JSX to ES5 using babel: babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react
